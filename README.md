AlignExercise is a full-stack web application that acts as your personal AI fitness coach. It uses your computer's webcam and real-time pose estimation to guide you through exercises, count your repetitions automatically, and provide live feedback on your form. Workout plans are dynamically generated and tailored to your personal biometrics (age, BMI) and progress.

*   **Live Form Correction:** Provides real-time feedback like "Keep your back straight!" to help prevent injury and ensure proper technique.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Saves user performance, calculates a completion percentage, and advances the user to the next "day" upon completion.

*   **Audio Feedback:** Uses the Web Speech API to provide audio cues, announcing the rep count as it happens.
